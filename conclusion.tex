\section{Concluding Remarks}

\begin{itemize}

\item We can use median trick and Chernoff bound to improve the probability of an existing algorithm.

\item For distinct elements problem, we can also store the hashes $h(i)$ approximately. One example is to store the number of leading zeros, and it only cost $O(\log \log n)$ bits per hash value, and that is the idea behind another algorithm called HyperLogLog.

\item For the impossibility results, we can also prove that randomized exact algorithm won't work.

\end{itemize}
